# Security Policy

## Introduction

Please use this public repo to report issues and vulnerabilities in either our REST API, or our front-end client.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We currently don't operate a bug bounty program, but we intend to in future.

We are willing to provide non-monetary recognition of various kinds - please create a new ticket in this repo and leave your email address too. We'll speak to you personally, once your ticket/issue has been accepted.
